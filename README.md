# EAM-Project
The EAM-Project repository was created with the aim of publishing projects as a team of three great friends: 
- Mariano https://github.com/MarianoMaldonado-dev
- Edgardo https://github.com/echigardo
- Anthony https://github.com/anthonybanion
To put our knowledge into practice, encourage collaborative work, and implement good practices.
